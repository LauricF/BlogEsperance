      <description>Nice and constructive graphics play an important role when it comes to conveying a message.
I personnaly use R with ggplot2, a graphic package. the main advantages of ggplot is that is come with a grammar, a series of rules which once learn, make it very easy to create new plots. Thus I recommend to learn ggplot when starting to use R. It is time consuming at first and the curve it steep but it is totally worth in the long term.</description>
