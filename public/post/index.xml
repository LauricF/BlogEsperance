      <description>Beyond the classic functions like summary(), or str() , there is a set of dedicated packages to explore a new dataset. In this post, I will describe three useful packages which give a good perspective on a new dataset. The first one is visdat which gives tools to visualise at one glance a new dataset.
Its major functions are vis_dat,vis_miss and ,vis_cor vis_dat takes litteraly “looking at the data”. This is useful to identify pattern and potential biais in the data.</description>

      <description>Nice and constructive graphics play an important role when it comes to conveying a message.
I personnaly use R with ggplot2, a graphic package. the main advantages of ggplot is that is come with a grammar, a series of rules which once learn, make it very easy to create new plots. Thus I recommend to learn ggplot when starting to use R. It is time consuming at first and the curve is steep but it is totally worth in the long term.</description>
