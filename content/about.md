I am a researcher in applied mathematics working at the university of Exeter. I am interested by the use of statistic and machine learning to improve clinical practice. I am currently working on the prediction of Type 1 diabetes thanks to [JDRF sponsoring](https://www.jdrf.org/) and my aim is to develop tools to identify children who are likely to develop type 1 diabetes and give them an adequate follow up.
