Nice and constructive graphics play an important role when it comes to conveying a message.


I personnaly use [R](https://www.r-project.org/) with  [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), a graphic package. the main advantages of ggplot is that is come with a grammar, a series of rules which once learn, make it very easy to create new plots. Thus I recommend to learn ggplot when starting to use R. It is time consuming at first and the curve is steep but it is totally worth in the long term.

However the following rules to produce graphics efficiently can be applied to any langage.

## Do not reinvent the wheel

Whatever you want to display, there is a high chance that somebody have already done it.

For simple graph it is often quicker to do them from scratch but for complicated one when there is not a clear idea about what I really want to do, it is usually time-efficient to do a quick research:

Here are my favorit websites to start:

* [Data to viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com/), this really well organised website help to find the best graph given the data you have. There caveat section is very useful to implement clear and accessible plot. 
Code is in R, Python, D3.js and flourish.

* [The r graph gallery](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/index.html) is useful to identify quickly an efficient way to display your data with all the necessary code to produce it.

* [Ggplot2 extensions](https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/), a large number of packages have been made to extend the capability of ggplot2, going through the display items can give you ideas and save you a lot of time.

## Choice of colours

Choice of colours is important and can transform the perception and the time that people are ready to give to a graphic. It is particularly important to choose the right colour as often default colour are all but wonderful. I try to use colour blind people palette when possible;

* [Friendly palette of colour for colour blind peope](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/colorBlindness/vignettes/colorBlindness.html)

* If you are not suffering from a color vision deficiency it is very hard to imagine how it looks like to be colorblind. [The Color BLIndness Simulator](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/) can close this gap for you.
